# TheForecastWeatherApp
This is the result of a fairly extensive course by Mr. Emiliano Ocariz. This application makes a fairly extended weather forecast for various places in the world. It is a front app in which React js is used and a quite extensive review of this library is given. Use npm start and enjoy.
